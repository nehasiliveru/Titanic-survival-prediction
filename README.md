# Titanic-survival-prediction
The Titanic tragedy, which occurred in 1912, remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. The ship, carrying over 2,200 passengers and crew members, sank after hitting an iceberg, resulting in over 1,500 fatalities. 
The tragedy was not only catastrophic due to the sheer number of casualties but also because of the inequalities in survival rates among different passenger groups. 
The survival rate varied significantly based on factors such as age, class, gender, and fare, with certain groups—such as women, children, and first-class passengers—having higher chances of survival. 
Predicting survival based on these passenger characteristics has become a widely studied problem in data science, often framed as a binary classification task. 
In this context, the task is to predict whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) based on their attributes, which include Passenger Class , Gender , Age, Number of siblings or spouses the passenger was traveling with , Number of parents or children the passenger was traveling with, Fare , Embarked . 
The goal is to leverage these attributes to develop a predictive model that can estimate a passenger's likelihood of survival. This task is challenging due to several reasons: • Imbalanced Data • Missing or Incomplete Data • Complex Interactions
